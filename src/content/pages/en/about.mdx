## Who I am

My name is Le Hong Phong – Phong being the given name. I’m the mix of a published author, an open source proponent, a founder of several inspiring cultural/community projects, an avid reader, and a tireless wanderer.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/phnglh), [X](https://x.com/phonghngle). An outdated LinkedIn profile is also available. If you happen to read Vietnamese, I own a blog where I once in a while jot down thoughts, essays, and short stories.
