## Who I am

My name is Le Hong Phong – with Phong being my given name. I’m a Full Stack Engineer currently based in Vietnam. I work across the stack, from designing responsive user interfaces to building robust backend services. My toolkit includes technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, along with SQL and NoSQL database.

Beyond code, I’m an avid reader, always curious about topics ranging from technology and philosophy to literature and history. I also consider myself a tireless wanderer – someone who enjoys discovering new places, cultures, and perspectives, whether through travel or through stories.

You can usually find me tinkering with ideas or side projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/phnglh), sharing thoughts (and occasional sarcasm) on [X](https://x.com/phonghngle), or, if you're brave enough, browsing my rather outdated LinkedIn profile.

If you happen to read Vietnamese, I maintain a personal blog where I sometimes jot down reflections, essays, or short stories. It’s a space where I let thoughts roam freely, far beyond the confines of a tech resume.
